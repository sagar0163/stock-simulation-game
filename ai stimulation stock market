Here is a detailed, updated project plan for your AI simulation stock market game, incorporating all discussed features: scheduled money influx, controlled player capital, top-ups from the liquid pool, and realistic market simulation.

## AI Simulation Stock Market Game: Project Plan

### 1. **Project Overview**

- **Objective:**  
  - Build a web-based AI-driven stock market simulation for newcomers to practice trading and learn market dynamics.
  - Emulate real-world market behavior with controlled, scheduled increases in market liquidity.
  - Allow player top-ups only from the existing liquid pool, not by creating new money.
- **Target Audience:**  
  - Beginners interested in learning about stock markets and trading.

### 2. **Core Features**

- **Market Simulation**
  - AI-driven price fluctuations based on trading activity, news events, and random market factors[3][4][6].
  - Scheduled money influx: Every 10 minutes, add a fixed amount (e.g., â‚¹1,000) to the market liquid pool.
- **Player Management**
  - New players receive starting capital from the liquid pool.
  - Players can top up their accounts only if there is sufficient money in the liquid pool.
  - No arbitrary money creation; all funds come from the pool or scheduled increases.
- **Trading Interface**
  - Buy/sell stocks.
  - Portfolio tracking.
  - Market news and analytics.
- **Market Stability**
  - Total capital in the game is strictly controlled.
  - No sudden influx of money except through scheduled increases.
- **AI Simulation**
  - Simulate market participants (AI traders).
  - Generate news events and price changes.
  - React to player actions and market conditions.

### 3. **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend:** Angular (MEAN stack)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js (MEAN stack)
- **Database:** MongoDB (MEAN stack)
- **AI/ML:** Python (optional, for advanced simulation), or JavaScript-based AI libraries
- **Scheduling:** Node.js timers or `node-cron` for scheduled events

### 4. **Development Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Planning & Setup**
- **Define scope, objectives, and features**[2][7].
- **Architecture design:**  
  - Frontend: User dashboard, trading interface, analytics.
  - Backend: Game logic, market simulation, player management.
  - Database: Player accounts, market state, transaction history, liquid pool.
- **Set up development environment and MEAN stack tools.**

#### **Phase 2: Data & AI Model Preparation**
- **Collect and preprocess sample market data (if using real data for simulation)**[2][6].
- **Design AI rules for market simulation:**
  - Random price fluctuations.
  - Event-driven price changes (news, player actions).
  - AI traders as market participants.

#### **Phase 3: Core Development**
- **Frontend:**
  - User registration/login.
  - Trading dashboard: buy/sell, portfolio, market news.
  - Real-time updates (stock prices, news, liquid pool status).
- **Backend:**
  - Player management: registration, login, capital allocation.
  - Market simulation: price updates, scheduled money influx, event generation.
  - Transaction processing: buy/sell, top-up (from liquid pool).
  - API endpoints for frontend interaction.
- **Database:**
  - Store player data, market state, transaction history, liquid pool balance.

#### **Phase 4: AI Integration**
- **Implement AI-driven price changes and event generation.**
- **Add AI traders to simulate market activity.**
- **Integrate news feed and event triggers.**

#### **Phase 5: Testing**
- **Unit and integration testing for all features.**
- **Test scheduled money influx and top-up logic.**
- **User acceptance testing: simulate real trading scenarios.**

#### **Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring**
- **Deploy to a web server (cloud or local).**
- **Monitor performance and user feedback.**
- **Iterate based on feedback and analytics.**

### 5. **Workflow Diagram**

1. **Player Registration/Login**
2. **Player Joins Game:**
   - Backend checks liquid pool and assigns starting capital.
3. **Player Trades:**
   - Buy/sell stocks.
   - Real-time updates to portfolio and market.
4. **Player Top-Up:**
   - Only if liquid pool has sufficient funds.
5. **Scheduled Money Influx:**
   - Every 10 minutes, add fixed amount to liquid pool.
6. **Market Simulation:**
   - AI updates prices, generates news, simulates traders.

### 6. **Risk Management & Compliance**

- **Ensure data security and privacy.**
- **Comply with relevant regulations (if any).**
- **Monitor for bugs and performance issues.**

### 7. **Post-Launch Support**

- **Collect user feedback.**
- **Add new features (e.g., advanced analytics, more AI events).**
- **Maintain and update the system as needed.**
